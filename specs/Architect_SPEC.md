**THE** agent SHALL evaluate architectural alternatives

**Rationale**: Core architect capability
**Verification**: Instance demonstrates capability in operation

### CAP-ARC-003: Documentation

**WHEN** performing architect activities
**THE** agent SHALL record architecture decisions and rationale

**Rationale**: Core architect capability
**Verification**: Instance demonstrates capability in operation
